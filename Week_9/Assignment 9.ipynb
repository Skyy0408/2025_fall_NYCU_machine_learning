    "A Proposal for Embodied Adaptive Intelligence\n",
    "Our research aims to address one of the greatest remaining challenges in artificial intelligence: endowing machines with \"common sense\"  to enable general-purpose, autonomous interaction with the physical world. This document outlines a 20-year capability goal, the machine learning methodology required, and a concrete first research step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach is heavily informed by the cognitive architecture proposed by Yann LeCun in \"A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence\"  and utilizes advanced simulation techniques as described in recent studies on Neural Operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Future Capability: The \"Physical World Agent\"\n",
    "A. Capability Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Our 20-year goal is to develop Embodied Adaptive Intelligence: an autonomous agent that can be placed in a completely unknown physical environment and execute complex, high-level commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This capability transcends simple recognition or navigation. It requires the agent to build an internal, predictive \"world model\" on the fly. It must be able to infer the physical properties of objects it has never seen (e.g., fragility, weight, rigidity)  and understand the affordance of tools (e.g., a knife is for cutting, a handle is for pulling) to plan and execute multi-step tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Application Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 1: The Full-Function Household Robot: Current AI (like vacuums) cannot perform non-trivial tasks. Our agent could respond to the command, \"Prepare the ingredients for pasta.\" It would enter an unfamiliar kitchen, identify the refrigerator, deduce how to open the handle, locate the eggs, and—crucially—use its internal physics model to determine the minimal force required to grasp the eggs without crushing them. This capability would revolutionize elderly care and general-purpose assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Adaptive \"Dark Factories\": Today's industrial robots are powerful but rigid, limited to repeating a single, pre-programmed task. Our agent could power an adaptive factory. Given a new 3D schematic, the agent would analyze the assembly steps, pick up unfamiliar tools, and execute the new task, effectively re-tooling itself with zero human intervention. This would enable true mass customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Involved Machine Learning Methods\n",
    "Achieving this goal requires a hybrid architecture where different learning paradigms build the core components of an intelligent agent. We will follow the architecture proposed by LeCun, centered on a World Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) (The Foundation): The agent's \"physical intuition\" will be learned not through millions of expensive real-world trials , but through observation. The World Model , which acts as an internal physics simulator, will be pre-trained on massive unlabeled video datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology: We will specifically implement a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). A JEPA learns to predict the future in an abstract representation space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data/Goal: It doesn't predict every pixel  (which is impossibly complex). Instead, it learns abstract concepts like \"object permanence\" , \"solidity\" , and \"gravity\"  by predicting how these abstract representations evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Tools: To make this World Model a true \"simulator,\" we will leverage Neural Operators. As outlined in the ICML tutorial, these are AIs designed to learn the underlying physical laws (operators) that govern how systems evolve, allowing our agent to learn a robust, generalizable model of physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reinforcement Learning (RL) (The Planner): RL is not used to learn physics, but to use the physics model for planning and action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology: The system features an Actor module  (the planner) and a Cost module (the driver). The Actor proposes a sequence of actions (e.g., \"apply 0.5N of force\"). The World Model predicts the outcome (e.g., \"egg is picked up safely\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback & Data: The Critic (a trainable part of the Cost module ) evaluates this predicted outcome against a hard-wired Intrinsic Cost (e.g., \"breaking objects is bad\"). The Actor then uses gradient-based optimization to find the action sequence that minimizes the predicted future cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Supervised Learning (The Basis): This is used for the \"Perception\" module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data/Goal: Standard labeled datasets are used to give the agent its initial ability to see and categorize the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The \"Modeled\" First Step: A Simplified Problem\n",
    "To begin our 20-year journey, we must first build the core feedback loop of the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: \"Grasping an Unknown, Fragile Object.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation: This simple task is the atomic unit of our final goal. It perfectly tests the interaction between the key modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Perception: Must identify the object's geometry from visual data (e.g., point clouds).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "World Model: Must infer the unseen property of \"fragility\" and predict the outcome of a given grasping force.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Actor-Cost Loop : The Actor must optimize its proposed force to satisfy two opposing goals: be strong enough to overcome gravity (a \"Cost\") but gentle enough to avoid the crushing threshold (an \"Intrinsic Cost\" ).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Testability: We will build a physics simulator (e.g., MuJoCo/PyBullet). We will randomly generate 10,000 objects with varying shapes, weights, and crushing thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success Metric: % of trials where the agent successfully lifts the object to a target height without applying a force greater than its crushing threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "Math: 3D Geometry; Inverse Kinematics; Optimization Theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML: 3D Deep Learning (e.g., PointNet) for Perception; Deep RL (e.g., SAC) for the Actor-Critic loop; and a JEPA model  (trained on physics videos) to serve as the initial World Model.\n",
