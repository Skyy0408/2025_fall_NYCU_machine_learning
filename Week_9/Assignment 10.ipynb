    "## 1. Future AI Ability: Fully Autonomous, Accident-Free Driving in Dense Traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "One important ability that AI cannot currently achieve, but may reasonably accomplish 20 years from now, is **fully autonomous, accident-free driving in dense and highly interactive traffic environments**. Unlike today’s semi-autonomous systems that depend strongly on human supervision, this future capability would allow an AI agent to independently plan, navigate, and make safety-critical decisions amidst unpredictable human drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability has major societal significance. Road transportation affects millions of people daily, and most traffic accidents arise from human error. A highly reliable autonomous driving system could drastically reduce collisions, provide mobility for populations who cannot drive, and improve overall traffic efficiency. Achieving such performance requires far more than simple perception; the AI must **predict multi-agent behaviors**, reason under uncertainty, and plan safe trajectories several seconds into the future. These challenges highlight a level of integrated intelligence that current AI systems have not yet achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Learning Paradigms Involved: Supervised Regression + Model-Based RL (via MPC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing such an advanced driving capability requires combining multiple machine-learning paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, low-level driving actions—such as **acceleration change** and **steering-angle change**—can be learned through **supervised regression**. Following the methodology of [Separating the World Model and Ego Models for Self-Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07184), large-scale human driving datasets can be used to train a model that maps observed states to continuous control actions, providing human-like priors for basic driving behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, fully autonomous driving also involves **sequential decision-making under uncertainty**, which aligns with the objectives of **reinforcement learning (RL)**. Traditional RL, however, is impractical in real-world driving because it requires millions of interactions that are slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous.  \n",
    "To overcome these limitations, a **model-based RL approach implemented through Model Predictive Control (MPC)** is more suitable. Instead of interacting with the real world, the agent uses a **learned world model** to simulate future trajectories and chooses actions that minimize a cumulative cost. This preserves the core idea of RL—optimizing long-term outcomes—while avoiding unsafe real-world exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the task naturally involves a hybrid framework:\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning:** provides action regression and forward dynamics models.  \n",
    "- **Model-Based RL via MPC:** performs multi-step simulated rollouts and selects actions that minimize the trajectory cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This combination is appropriate because the task requires both large-scale data-driven modeling and safe long-horizon planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. First-Step Model Problem: Implementing DFM-KM MPC\n",
    "\n",
    "As a practical first step toward the long-term goal of fully autonomous driving, I propose implementing the **DFM-KM MPC** approach from *Separating the World Model and Ego Models for Self-Driving*. This simplified model captures the essential subproblem of **planning safe trajectories using a learned world model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How this simplified task represents the ultimate ability\n",
    "DFM-KM MPC separates ego dynamics and environmental dynamics:  \n",
    "- The **ego vehicle** is predicted using a differentiable kinematic model.  \n",
    "- The **environment** is predicted using a learned stochastic world model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This decomposition isolates a key component of full autonomy—understanding how one’s own actions propagate into future states while accounting for surrounding traffic. Although simplified, this setting still requires the agent to handle uncertainty, perform multi-step prediction, and optimize actions over a short planning horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testability of the model problem\n",
    "The problem is highly testable because:\n",
    "- Ego-state updates are analytically differentiable.  \n",
    "- The environment model provides predicted rasterized states.  \n",
    "- The cost function \\( C^{km} \\) is implemented with differentiable masks, enabling interpretable visualization.  \n",
    "- Success can be measured using collision rates, smoothness, or minimized cumulative cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These properties make it straightforward to evaluate whether the model is learning the correct driving behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required mathematical and ML tools\n",
    "Solving this model problem requires:\n",
    "- Supervised regression for action prediction or forward models.  \n",
    "- A differentiable kinematic ego-model.  \n",
    "- A learned world model \\( f_\\theta^{env} \\).  \n",
    "- Gradient-based trajectory optimization using **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**.  \n",
    "- Reinforcement-learning principles for multi-step cost minimization in simulation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these components form a feasible yet meaningful first research step toward the long-term goal of safe, fully autonomous driving.\n",
